# Emotion-Analyzer
Implemented an emotion analyzer which classifies emotions of a person using his/her heartbeat variations. Natural Language Processing is done for sentiment analysis based on heartbeat variations. The heartbeat is detected using an IoT based wrist wearable technology, which detects heartbeats in the form of pulses.
